# shortenLongRuns(L, k) [15 pts]
# Write the non-destructive function shortenLongRuns(L, k) that takes a list L and a positive integer k, and 
# non-destructively returns a similar list, only without any run of k consecutive equal values in L. This means that 
# any values that would otherwise produce a consecutive run of k elements are not present. 
# For example: 
# assert(shortenLongRuns([2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3], 2) == [2, 3, 5, 3]) 
# assert(shortenLongRuns([2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3], 3) == [2, 3, 5, 5, 3]) 
# Note: your function may not just create a copy of L and call the destructive version of this function (below) on 
# that copy and return it. Instead, you must directly construct the result here.


def shortenlongruns(L, k):
	# Your code goes here
	count = 1
	a = []
	for i in range(0,len(L)):
		if count < k:
			a.append(L[i])
		if(i < len(L) - 1 and L[i] == L[i+1]):
			count += 1
		else:
			count = 1
	return a
